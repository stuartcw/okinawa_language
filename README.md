# Uchināguchi - Okinawan language


The dialect of Uchināguchi (Okinawan language) most commonly taught in study books and learning resources is the Shuri–Naha dialect, also known as Central Okinawan[^1](#footnote-1)[^3](#footnote-3)[^4](#footnote-4). This variant was historically the language of the royal court in Shuri, the capital of the Ryukyu Kingdom, and thus became the regional and literary standard[1](#footnote-1)[4](#footnote-4). As a result, it is the version most widely documented in dictionaries, grammar guides, and language textbooks.

Most English and Japanese learning materials focus on this standard form, sometimes simply referred to as "Uchināguchi" or "Okinawan" without further specification[3](#footnote-3)[13](#footnote-13). The Shuri–Naha dialect is also the basis for resources such as the Okinawan-English Wordbook, which is specifically noted to be based on the Naha dialect—a central part of the Shuri–Naha area[13](#footnote-13). While Uchināguchi encompasses several local dialects, the Shuri–Naha variant is the most accessible and standardized for learners, making it the primary dialect taught in study books and classes[1](#footnote-1)[4](#footnote-4)[13](#footnote-13).
